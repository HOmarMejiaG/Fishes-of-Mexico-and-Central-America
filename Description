This repository comprise the results of the paper titled "Analysis of endemicity and regionalization of freshwater ichthyofauna of Middle America: Towards a consensus approach based on different methodologies" by Amairany Bernal-Portillo, Fabian Pérez-Miranda and Omar Mejía.

The Excel file contains the raw data of the gbif collection records of the freshwater fishes of Mexico and Central America

The TNT folder includes the Presence-Absence matrices (PAM) used in the Parsimony analysis of endemicity using grid cells, FAO basins and Pfastetter Hydrobasins

 The UPGMA folder includes the Presence-Absence matrices (PAM) used in the phenetic analysis for the definition of endemism areas using grid cells, FAO basins and Pfastetter Hydrobasins, as well as ANOSIM results, UPGMA dendrograms and indicator species for each analysis

 THe VNDM compressesd file includes jpg files of each one of the consensus areas obtained with the 30% and 50% threshold using both, one degree and half degree grid cells

 The maps folder include the shapefiles used in this study, grid cells, Fao basins and subbbasins and Pfastetter level 4 and 5 hydrobasins for the study area
